## Docker

At the ACDH-CH we use a centralized database-server. So instead of spawning a database for each service our services are talking to a database on this centralized db-server. This setup is reflected in the dockerized setting as well, meaning it expects an already existing database (either on your host, e.g. accessible via 'localhost' or some remote one)

### building the image

    docker build -t diauma:latest .
    docker build -t diauma:latest --no-cache .

### running the image

To run the image you should provide an `.env` file to pass in needed environment variables; see example below:

    docker run -it -p 8020:8020 --rm --env-file docker.env --name diauma diauma:latest
