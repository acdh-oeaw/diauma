        <h2 id="type">Types</h2>

        <p>
            Types are used to track information which entities have in common. E.g. there is a type "Features" for maps
            which can include items like "Legend", "Stamp" and so on. They are hierarchic, meaning the type "Stamp"
            can have sub types e.g. 'Royal stamp' and 'Unknown stamp'. Also it is possible the select multiple types
            so a map can feature a "Royal stamp" and an "Unknown stamp".
        </p>
        <p>
            Existing type hierarchies can be edited and extended by every user but can only be deleted, if they have
            no subtypes and no associated entries.
        </p>
        <p>Admins can add new type hierarchies in the backend.</p>
